# ANOMA-Simulated-INTENT-CENTRIC-PREDICTION-MARKET 

ðŸ”® Anoma Intent-Centric Prediction Market (Simulation Demo)

This project is a simulation of an intent-centric prediction market built on the design principles of Anoma.

Instead of traditional transactions, users express intents â†’ these are registered, monitored by solvers, and executed once conditions are met.
This demo shows how prediction markets can run on that model using simulated tokens, markets, and oracle resolutions.

âœ¨ Features
-	Daily faucet â†’ every user gets 10,000 $XAN + 5,000 USDC test tokens.
-	30â€“40 seeded markets â†’ crypto, macro, sports, culture, degen.
-	Intent submission flow â†’ state conviction (yes/no), stake tokens, register intent.
-   Solver simulation â†’ auto-matches intents across outcomes.
-  racle resolution (admin) â†’ resolve market outcomes and pay winners.
-  Payouts â†’ pari-mutuel style, with fees for treasury + solver simulation.
- In-memory DB â†’ easy to reset and experiment. (Swap to Postgres later.)

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
ðŸ”·	Backend: Node.js, Express, body-parser, uuid, CORS.
ðŸ”·	Data: in-memory store (planned: Postgres).
ðŸ”·	Auth: placeholder for Twitter/Discord OAuth (demo uses ?user=twitter:alice).
ðŸ”·	Solver Engine: simple auto-matcher, expandable into economic solver.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone repo

git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/anoma-intent-market.git
cd anoma-intent-market

2. Install dependencies

npm install

3. Run server

npm run start

Server starts on http://localhost:3000.
Markets auto-seeded if empty. Solver runs every 2s.

ðŸ”— API Endpoints

Faucet

GET /api/faucet?user=twitter:alice

Claims daily balance: 10k XAN + 5k USDC.

Get markets

GET /api/markets

Lists all active markets.

Submit intent

POST /api/intents
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "market_id": "<market-id>",
  "outcome": "yes",
  "stake": "100",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "maker_pub": "twitter:alice"
}

Resolve market (admin)

POST /api/admin/resolve
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "market_id": "<market-id>",
  "result": "yes"
}

Get balance

GET /api/balance?user=twitter:alice


â¸»

ðŸ§ª Example Flow
	1.	Claim faucet for twitter:alice.
	2.	Claim faucet for twitter:bob.
	3.	Both submit intents on the same market with opposite outcomes.
	4.	Solver auto-matches intents.
	5.	Admin/oracle resolves market â†’ payouts sent to winning side.

ðŸ“¦ Roadmap
	â€¢	Add frontend (Next.js) for full UX.
	â€¢	Integrate Twitter/Discord OAuth.
	â€¢	Persist data with Postgres.
	â€¢	Extend solver logic with real matching + solver bonding.
	â€¢	Connect to Anoma testnet via intent adapters.
	â€¢	NFT badges + leaderboard gamification.

âš¡ Vision

This repo is not just a toy DEX â€” itâ€™s a conceptual playground for how prediction markets, intents, and solvers will look in an Anoma-powered economy.
By simulating the intent â†’ commit â†’ execution pipeline, we can prototype and demo UX flows before mainnet.
